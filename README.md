SongShift Localizations

Thank you for the interest in localizing SongShift to your native language. There are 3 files I would appreciate if you could translate. The Localizable.strings file in App Strings folder, the Engish.txt in the App Description folder and the English.txt file in the App Update folder.

You can either fork and do a pull request or send me the translated text to contact@songshiftapp.com

Thank you!
